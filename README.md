#### Stores 
contains the 50 Toy Store locations (each record represents one store), with fields containing details about the store location, type, and date it opened
#### Sales
contains the units sold in over 800,000 sales transactions from January 2017 to October 2018 (each record represents the purchase of a specific product at a specific store on a specific date)
#### Inventory
